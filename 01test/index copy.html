    <h1>Proximity</h1>
        <h2><b>Proximity refers to</b> the spatial relationship between elements on a web page. Elements that are close to each other in the code are considered to be in proximity. This proximity affects how users perceive and interact with the elements on the page. For instance, elements placed closely together can be perceived as related or grouped, while those spaced far apart may not appear related and can disrupt the user experience. Understanding proximity in HTML5 is crucial for designing layouts that are visually cohesive and intuitive for users to navigate.</h2>
        
        <h3><b>I have used proximity by</b> organizing related elements together in my HTML documents. For example, when designing a navigation bar, I ensure that menu items are placed close to each other in the code to visually group them. This helps users quickly identify and navigate to different sections of the website. Additionally, when creating forms, I arrange form fields and labels in close proximity to improve usability and clarity. By understanding the importance of proximity in HTML5, I can create more intuitive and user-friendly web experiences for my projects in class. Promximity was more of my struggled areas in the assigemnts. I knew i could have done btter about making sure all items were more consistent.

        <h1>Alignment</h1>
        <h2><b>Alignment refers to</b> the positioning of elements within a web page layout. By aligning elements horizontally and vertically, developers can create visually appealing and organized designs. Whether it's aligning text, images, or other content within containers such as divs or sections, proper alignment enhances readability and creates a cohesive user experience. Utilizing alignment techniques in HTML allows developers to create structured and polished layouts that guide users' attention and improve overall usability.</h2>
        
        <h3><b>I have used alignment by</b> enhanceing the visual structure and readability of my HTML documents. When designing layouts, I ensure that elements are aligned both horizontally and vertically to create a sense of order and coherence. For instance, I align text and images within containers such as divs or sections to maintain consistent spacing and presentation. Proper alignment also helps to create a professional appearance and improves the overall user experience. Whether aligning elements within a grid layout or centering content on the page, understanding alignment principles in HTML5 allows me to create polished and aesthetically pleasing websites in my coding projects. Alignment is a huge strength of mine and being able to incoprorate it in the ways i did was great. I could have found more ways to describe alignment as I would use the videos to remind me but I could do better by memorizing them.

        <h1>Repetition</h1>
        <h2><b>Repetition refers to</b> the reuse of elements or patterns throughout a web page or website. It involves incorporating consistent design elements, such as colors, fonts, or navigation structures, to create a cohesive visual identity. By repeating these elements across various sections or pages, developers establish a sense of familiarity and reinforce branding. Moreover, repetition can enhance user experience by providing predictability and making it easier for visitors to navigate and understand the content. Through thoughtful repetition in HTML, developers can effectively communicate key messages and maintain a unified design language across their digital projects.</h2>
        
         <h3><b>I have used repetiton by</b> incorporating consistent design elements throughout my HTML documents. For instance, I maintain uniformity in colors, fonts, and layout structures across different sections of the website. By repeating these design patterns, I establish a cohesive visual identity that enhances the user experience and reinforces the website's branding. Additionally, I utilize repetition in navigation menus and footer elements to provide consistency and make it easier for users to navigate between pages. Through strategic repetition, I ensure that visitors can easily recognize and interact with the content on my website, promoting usability and engagement. An important part to building a site but one of the more easy parts to do. As far are things I could have done better was a more simple but elegant design that stayed very consistent in my site.
        </h3>
        
        <h1>Contrast</h1>
        <h2><b>Contrast refers to</b> the noticeable differences in various aspects of a web page, such as colors, fonts, sizes, or layout elements. It involves intentionally setting elements apart from each other to create visual interest and hierarchy. By juxtaposing elements with contrasting attributes, such as light and dark colors, large and small fonts, or bold and subtle textures, developers can draw attention to specific content or create emphasis. Contrast plays a crucial role in improving readability, guiding user attention, and enhancing the overall visual impact of a web page. Through skillful use of contrast in HTML design, developers can create dynamic and engaging user experiences that effectively communicate their intended message.</h2>
        
         <h3><b>I have used contrast by</b> carefully selecting and juxtaposing different elements within my HTML design. For instance, I employ contrasting colors to highlight important information or call-to-action buttons, making them stand out against the background. Additionally, I vary font sizes and styles to create hierarchy and emphasis, ensuring that key messages are easily noticed by users. By strategically placing elements with contrasting attributes, such as size, color, or texture, I enhance readability and guide user attention throughout the website. This intentional use of contrast in my HTML design not only improves the overall visual appeal but also helps to communicate information effectively to the audience. Contrast I believe elevates the designa and often times I think goes unnoticed. But even I had times I should have had more contrast in my design.

        <h1>Typography</h1>
        <h2><b>Typography refers to</b> how text is styled and arranged on a web page. It includes choosing fonts, adjusting sizes, spacing, and alignment to create readable and visually appealing content. Using CSS, developers can control typography to enhance the overall look and feel of a website, impacting readability and user experience.</h2>
        
         <h3><b>I have followed typography principles</b> by carefully selecting fonts, adjusting sizes, spacing, and alignment to ensure readability and visual harmony on my web pages. Additionally, I have paid attention to hierarchy and contrast to guide user attention and create a cohesive design language. By adhering to typography best practices, I aim to enhance the overall aesthetics and usability of my website. Little do people know how cruicial type is to design and it is not any differnt here. I tried to impliment as many fundamentals principals as I knew but I could even see places that my type was iffy in parts of my site.
