    <h1>HOME</h1>
    <p>Sneakers have been the life blood of society. Fron the early years of Jesus he walked to roads of Jerusalem in what we now know as the <strong>Jesus J's</strong> or Jesus 1's. As the world progressed so did the sneaker idustry or as others would call it, the <em>Footwear</em> industry.</p> 
    
    <p>Now as I cannot grab from anohter source who might speak more formal than me about shoes I will begin dumping my knowledge of shoes onto you (the reader). As this is the home page I would like to address this website was made striclty for the sneaker heads. For the poeple who love to put their personality into their footwear. This doesn't always mean loud and strange. Becasue peronalites can be different. You can be loud and stand out or quiet and sleek. Which is why sneakers are more than a shoe. Years of crafting and creating shoes has come before me. But my goal is to keep that hisotry going. To not only settle and enjoy the shoe industry but advacne it and make it something better or different when I first came into it. So without further adue. I give you <strong>"sky"</strong> the colleciton.</p>
    
    <h2>Where it started</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Most will say the start of sneaker culture began wiht the Jordan 1. Created by <a>Nike</a> for the new basketball star Michael Jordan but his first shoe was actually the Air Ships. Not as iconic or as loved as the Jordan 1 but I believe was an important part of the story.</li>
            <li>In 1892 a rubber company had developed a rubber sole that had a canvas upper. People said that it made steps so quiet that they called them "sneakers" So began the company <a>Keds</a>.</li>
        </ul>
